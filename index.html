    <p>In July I went camping for a week with some family friends. Somethings that we did were play <em>ultimate, volleyball, and boating.</em></p>

    <p>Something I like to do is play floor hockey. I have been playing for about <strong>11 years.</strong></p>

    Courses that I'm taking right now:
    <ul><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20213048461/">ACIT 1515 Scripting for IT</a></ul>
